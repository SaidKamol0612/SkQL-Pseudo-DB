# SkQL (Saidkamol Query Language)

**SkQL** is a domain-specific query language inspired by SQL and adapted to Uzbek language structure. It is designed for basic CRUD operations on a JSON-like database: create, read, update, and delete records.

Each query in SkQL consists of sections:

- `ASOSIY(...)` ‚Äî main operation (`QO'SH`, `KO'RSAT`, `YANGILA`, `O'CHIR`)
- `SHART(...)` ‚Äî condition (`QAYERDA`)
- `CHEKLOV(...)` ‚Äî limit
